# Plotting Spacecraft Trajectories
A quick jupyter notebook that plots the trajectories for different spacecraft in Stonyhurst Heliographic (HGS) system, or Heliocentric Earth Equatorial (HEEQ) system, and the Carrington Heliographic (HGC) system. The notebook is an adaptation from sunpy's example gallery 'Obtaining a spacecraft trajectory from JPL Horizons' found [here](https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/generated/gallery/units_and_coordinates/ParkerSolarProbe_trajectory.html#sphx-glr-generated-gallery-units-and-coordinates-parkersolarprobe-trajectory-py).

The end of the jupyter notebook includes a method for creating a movie from a series of frames.

Create a compatible python environment as:
`conda env create -f trajectories_environment.yml`
